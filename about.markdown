I'm Drew, a software developer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA on the
[Xbox Game Pass for PC](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/pc-games)
team. That's me on the left. 

I've also worked for a few different companies as an intern. 
I built a decent amount of an MVP for an ed-tech startup in State College called
[Live It](https://www.liveitu.com). I also worked at
[StudioLabs](http://studiolabs.com) in NYC, a digital agency where I did client
work for companies like Shake Shack, Estee Lauder, Paula Deen, and Zype. In the
summer of 2017, I worked on the Discovery & Collaboration team at 
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Engineering Intern in 
Redmond, WA, where I returned to work full time for a year before moving to my
current team.

When I'm not in a text editor, I like to read, cook, watch sports, and play games,
among other things. Sometimes, I even write about these things on here.
