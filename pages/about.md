I'm Drew, a student currently pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at
Pennsylvania State University in State College, PA (and the small human next to
Killer Mike in that picture to the right). In my free time, I've built
a few side projects (mostly in the realm of web applications, they and some
stuff I've built for my courses can be found on my
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/drewhiggins)).

I've also worked as a developer for a few different companies. I built a decent
amount of an MVP for an ed-tech startup in State College called
[Live It](https://www.liveitu.com). I also worked at
[StudioLabs](http://studiolabs.com) in NYC, a digital agency where I did client
work for companies like Shake Shack, Estee Lauder, Paula Deen, and Zype. This
past summer, I worked on the Discovery & Collaboration team at 
[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) as a Software Engineering Intern in 
Redmond, WA.
