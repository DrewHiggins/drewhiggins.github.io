*In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic here in the United States, and consequently the suspension of all live televised sports, there seems to be a potential for whichever sport comes back first to see an explosion of popularity, since sports fans will yearn to watch anything they can after this multiple month long drought. With the news that the MLB is trying to restart play sometime in late May, there is a high probability that the first sport to return will be baseball.*

*I love baseball. I used to play it, I watch it religiously when it's in season, I know a lot of the trivia about it, all that. I know a lot of people really don't like baseball, or don't care about it. But I also know that a lot of people that don't usually watch baseball will be watching it if there's no alternative, and for that reason (and so my girlfriend doesn't have to hear me talk about how much I miss it anymore), I wanted to write an all-encompassing guide to the sport for people of varying levels of knowledge about it.*

*This guide will come in parts, starting with the basic rules of the game, and finishing up with advanced strategy and "sabermetric" analysis that hardcore fans fiddle over. Outlined below, you will find my goal for the reader after completing each part of the guide:*

*Part I: You can watch a baseball game on TV and understand what is happening and what all the things on the scoreboard mean.*
*Part II: You can understand some of the basics of baseball strategy and some of the corners of the rule book.*
*Part III: You can score a baseball game and know the basic stats that are reported in most baseball publications, like a newspaper*
*Part IV: You can hold your own with a barfly at your local dive bar about the current state of baseball.*

*There's a lot to cover in these posts, so let's get started without further ado.*

## Part I: The Basics

*"In our sun-down perambulations, of late, through the outer parts of Brooklyn, we have observed several parties of youngsters playing 'base', a certain game of ball ... Let us go forth awhile, and get better air in our lungs. Let us leave our close rooms ... the game of ball is glorious." &mdash;Walt Whitman*
