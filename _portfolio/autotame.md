Bukkit was a general purpose plugin framework for Minecraft servers a few years
ago, before it got shutdown due to a DMCA notice. During it's time as the go-to
server program for the game, I made a couple small plugins to fulfill user
requests on their message boards.

One of the plugins I made was called AutoTame, and it would simply the process
of a player taming a wolf. Normally, this could be a tedious process, and one
server administrator wanted the ability for players to be able to tame the
nearest wolf, and be able to customize its collar color and other options, and
my plugin did exactly that.

With Bukkit being defunct, the source code for my plugin is fairly useless.
However, if you'd like to view it, you can do so
[here](https://github.com/drewhiggins/AutoTame). I also wrote a blog post when
I made it with more info, which can be found
