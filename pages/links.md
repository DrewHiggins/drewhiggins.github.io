I browse the web quite a bit, and here are some of the sites I frequent/reference. You may find 
them useful, or you may not, but here they are if you want to check them out.

## Programming

**[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/news)**: A site run by startup accelerator [Y 
Combinator](http://www.ycombinator.com/) that allows users to post thought provoking articles, 
usually about math and tech.

**[Joel on Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)**: Joel Spolsky is one of my idols in the 
industry and the founder of [Fog Creek Software](http://www.fogcreek.com/) and (more famously) 
[Stack Overflow/Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com). His blog, Joel on Software, provides 
great career advice for programmers and management advice for aspiring entrepreneurs. 

**[Paul Graham's Essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)**: A programmer and investor, 
Paul Graham started Y Combinator with Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Trevor Blackwell. 
Here is a collection of his essays, which are useful commentary on the software industry, 
investing, politics, and more.

**[/r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/)**: A good forum for asking 
questions about jobs in tech, as well as a great source for resume and career advice on things 
like how to ask for raises, how to build a portfolio, and more.

**[OverAPI](http://overapi.com/)**: A collection of API, CLI, and programming language 
cheatsheets, useful as a bookmark or browser homepage for when you can't remember a function 
name or terminal command.

**[The Daily WTF](http://thedailywtf.com/)**: Useful if you ever think you're bad at programming
and want to assure yourself that there are much, *much* worse people at it out there.

## Non-Programming

**[The Art of Manliness](http://www.artofmanliness.com/)**: Guides on how to do old fashioned 
guy stuff like changing tires, style, and building good habits for modern men.

**[[d]online](http://don.citarella.net/)**: A personal blog about web design and art written 
by my brother-in-law, who also runs a digital agency called [era404](http://www.era404.com) 
and hosts pretty sweet BBQs from time to time.

**[GoNintendo](http://gonintendo.com)**: A frequently updated Nintendo news aggregate blog 
with an awesome podcast and even better little community.
